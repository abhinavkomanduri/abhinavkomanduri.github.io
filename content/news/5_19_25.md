Today, I start the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia! I am excited to get started working in the Inan Research Lab under the supervision of Dr. Omer Inan and Dr. Zeineb Bouzid. This summer, I will be working on developing deep-learning models to predict blood hemorrhaging status based on physiological signals from wearable sensing data. Throughout the summer, I also have the opportunity to participate in industry site tours, attend workshops and seminars for graduate development, and present my work at a final research symposium.
